## Overview

Scaling inference-time computation has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve strong reasoning performance, but inherently sequential decoding leads to substantial latency. We introduce **ThreadWeaver**, a framework for adaptive parallel reasoning that achieves accuracy on par with popular sequential reasoning models while significantly reducing inference latency.

ThreadWeaver utilizes a two-stage parallel trajectory generator for high-quality data creation, a trie-based training-inference co-design for compatibility with off-the-shelf engines, and a parallelization-aware reinforcement learning framework (P-GRPO). Across six mathematical reasoning benchmarks, ThreadWeaver achieves accuracy comparable to cutting-edge sequential models (e.g., 79.9% on AIME24) while delivering up to **1.53x average speedup** in token latency.

Sequential reasoning solves the problem step by step iteratively, so its reasoning latency grows proportionally to the length of the reasoning chain. ThreadWeaver instead creates concurrent reasoning threads adaptively that tackle different parts of the solution through `spawn` and `join` operations, effectively shortening the critical path when additional compute is available.

## Methodology

### Parallel Trajectory Format

We extend standard autoregressive generation with lightweight control tokens (`<Parallel>`, `<Outlines>`, `<Thread>`) arranged in a fork-join pattern.

<details>
<summary><strong>Deep Dive: Trajectory Structure</strong></summary>

Our format introduces specific tags to manage parallelism:

*   **`<think>`**: Marks the start of the reasoning trajectory, which may contain sequential segments and zero or more parallel blocks.
*   **`<Parallel> ... </Parallel>`**: Defines a parallel block. This is the container for branching logic.
*   **`<Outlines> ... </Outlines>`**: Consists of numbered **`<Outline>`** entries. These declare independent sub-tasks before they are executed. This planning step is crucial for the model to organize its parallel execution.
*   **`<Thread> i`**: The execution trajectory of the *i*-th sub-task. Crucially, **threads are generated independently and must not reference other threads.** At inference, each thread is generated in parallel by the engine.

This structured trajectory allows the model to explicitly define independent sub-tasks. The runtime orchestrator spawns parallel generation for each `<Thread>` while decoding all other segments autoregressively. This means the full trajectory can be generated without any modifications to the underlying inference engine (like vLLM or SGLang).
</details>

### Inference State Machine

Our inference orchestrator manages the "spawn" and "join" operations using standard request-completion APIs, allowing deployment on standard engines like vLLM or SGLang without modification.

![Inference Diagram](assets/decomposition_inference.png)

<details>
<summary><strong>Deep Dive: The 5-Phase State Machine</strong></summary>

We implement inference as a minimal state machine operating on request-response pairs. This allows us to use standard text-completion APIs without custom CUDA kernels or engine hacks.

1.  **Sequential Phase**: The model decodes sequentially (standard autoregressive generation) until it emits the `</Outlines>` token. This token acts as a stop signal for the sequential phase.
2.  **Parse Outlines**: The orchestrator extracts the numbered `<Outline>` entries from the generated text. These outlines define what needs to be done in parallel.
3.  **Parallel Phase**: For each outline *i*, the orchestrator issues a separate completion request. Each request is seeded with the prompt `<Thread> i:` appended to the previous context. These requests run in parallel on the inference engine. Each thread stops generating when it hits `</Thread>`.
4.  **Join**: Once all threads are complete, the orchestrator concatenates the original context and all the generated thread outputs. It appends the closing `</Parallel>` tag to form the context for the next phase.
5.  **Continue**: The model resumes sequential decoding from the joined context until it hits the next parallel block or the end of the response.

**Why this matters:** Because we use standard API calls, ThreadWeaver inherits all existing serving optimizations like paged attention and prefix caching. Prefix caching is particularly important here, as it prevents re-computing the KV cache for the shared prefix when spawning multiple threads.
</details>

### Trie-Based Training

We flatten the reasoning tree into a single sequence using a Trie structure with ancestor-only attention masking, preventing information leakage between threads during training.

![Training Diagram](assets/decomposition_training.png)

<details>
<summary><strong>Deep Dive: Trie Construction & Masking</strong></summary>

To fine-tune the model to output these parallel structures, we need to align the training data with the inference process. We use a Trie (prefix tree) approach:

1.  **Extraction**: We first extract all `<context, completion>` pairs that the inference state machine would encounter. Each context is a prompt (or partial generation), and each completion is the model's response (e.g., a single thread).
2.  **Trie Construction**: We insert these units into a token-level Trie. The root is the shared prompt. Branches in the Trie represent divergent continuations (e.g., different parallel threads). Nodes share the same ancestor path but are isolated from siblings.
3.  **Flattening & Masking**: We traverse the Trie to produce a single flat sequence for training. Crucially, we build an **ancestor-only attention mask**. Token *i* can attend to token *j* if and only if *j* is an ancestor of *i* in the Trie.

**The Result:** This prevents "cross-thread leakage" during training. Thread 1 cannot attend to Thread 2, even though they are packed into the same training sequence. This ensures that the training objective perfectly matches the independent parallel generation used at inference time.
</details>

### Parallel Trajectory Generation

Obtaining high-quality parallel reasoning data is difficult. We use a two-stage pipeline to create it from sequential data.

*   **Stage 1: Lightweight Rewriting**: We use a strong LLM (GPT-5) to identify parallel blocks in sequential traces. Unlike other methods, we do **not** regenerate the whole text. We perform minimal "surgical" rewrites to remove cross-thread dependencies, preserving the original reasoning quality.
*   **Stage 2: Scalable Self-Training**: We scale from 1k to 17k samples by having the model generate its own parallel data. We filter these trajectories for both **format correctness** and **answer correctness**, creating a massive dataset aligned with the model's own distribution.

### P-GRPO Reinforcement Learning

We introduce Parallelization-Aware GRPO (P-GRPO) to jointly optimize for accuracy and latency reduction.

*   **Parallelization-Aware Reward**: We introduce a dual-objective reward: `Correctness + Acceleration`. The acceleration term is proportional to the reduction in the "critical path" (longest thread), incentivizing the model to parallelize whenever possible without sacrificing accuracy.
*   **Stable Optimization**: Standard RL methods fail with parallel rewards because variance normalization causes the acceleration term to dominate. We introduce **mean-centered normalization** to stably optimize for both speed and accuracy.

<details>
<summary><strong>Deep Dive: P-GRPO & Rewards</strong></summary>

**Parallelization-Aware Reward**

We don't just reward correct answers. We add a soft **acceleration reward**. The total reward is `r = Correctness + Acceleration`. The acceleration term is proportional to the reduction in the "critical path" (longest thread) compared to the total token count. This incentivizes the model to parallelize whenever possible, but *only* if it leads to a correct answer.

**Thread-Wise Advantage Broadcast**

Standard RL methods struggle with parallel branches. In P-GRPO, we compute a single scalar reward for the *entire* trajectory and then **broadcast** the advantage to all tokens in that trajectory. This is mathematically justified and avoids the complexity of assigning partial credit to individual threads.

**Mean-Centered Normalization**

Standard GRPO divides by the standard deviation of rewards. This is problematic when all rollouts are correct: the correctness reward becomes constant and is removed by mean-centering. The remaining variance comes solely from the acceleration term. Dividing by the standard deviation then re-scales this acceleration term to unit variance, effectively cancelling out our small weighting factor ($\rho$) and causing the model to aggressively optimize for speed at the expense of accuracy. We fix this by removing the standard-deviation normalization:

| Standard GRPO | P-GRPO (Ours) |
| :--- | :--- |
| $$A_i = \frac{r_i - \mu}{\sigma}$$ | $$A_i = r_i - \mu$$ |
| Cancels $\rho$ when correct | Preserves scale $\rho$ |

This simple change stabilizes training and maintains a healthy balance between accuracy and speed.

**P-GRPO Loss Function**

The full P-GRPO loss function is defined as:

$$ \mathcal{L}_{\text{P-GRPO}}(\theta) = - \frac{1}{\sum_{p\in\mathcal{B}}\sum_{i=1}^{k} T_{p,i}} \sum_{p\in\mathcal{B}}\sum_{i=1}^{k} A_{p,i} \sum_{m=1}^{M_i} \log \pi_{\theta}(\text{comp}_{p}^{(i,m)} \mid \text{cont}_{p}^{(i,m)}) $$

Where $A_{p,i}$ is the broadcasted advantage, $M_i$ is the number of parallel blocks in trajectory $i$, and the inner sum accumulates log-probs over all completion tokens in the parallel structure.

### Comparison with State-of-the-Art

| Parallel-R1-Unseen (Zheng et al., 2025) | 4B | 16.3% | 27.3% |
| **ThreadWeaver (Ours)** | 8B | **79.9%** | **79.9%** |

## Qualitative Analysis

### Success Case: Trigonometric Expression Evaluation

**Prompt:** Evaluate $\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)$.

ThreadWeaver effectively decomposes this into two parallel paths:
1.  **Path 1**: Uses symbolic identities (product-to-sum).
2.  **Path 2**: Uses numerical verification.

Both paths converge to the same result (0.09), increasing confidence in the final answer.

### Failure Case: Redundant Computation

In some cases (e.g., counting trailing zeros in 42!), the model might split work redundantly.
*   **Thread 1**: Computes the main calculation.
*   **Thread 2**: Redundantly verifies it on smaller numbers (10!, 25!).
This doesn't accelerate the primary task, showing room for improvement in task decomposition.
